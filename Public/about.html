<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Chase Leak. I am learning to code with the intention of making some extra money on the side to pay off some bills. I am married to a woman named Ambrosia Renee Yarn and I have a 5 year old son named Carter. I also have a 9 year old dog named Jazmine. I hope to one day leave the pharmaceutical industry, which I currently work in, to do a job that I am more passionate about. The tech industry could be it, but we will see
   </p>

<p>So far I have learned how to make ordered and unordered lists, how to add headings, how to create links, amongst many other things. My skillset is growing everyday. My goal is to spend at least 30 minutes to an hour a day learning, for the rest of my life. I dont know where that will take me but i'm excited for the adventures I will go on.</p>

<p>Some of my other interests include photography, cooking, gardening, and music. I hope to be able to get to a place in life where I am able to spend more time doing those things and less time doing things I dont enjoy. I hope you have enjoyed learning a bit about me, please check out some of my projects and contact me to let me know what you thing or if you'd like to work with me. </p>
